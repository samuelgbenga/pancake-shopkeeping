## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing two approaches—concurrent and non-concurrent—to achieve a specific functionality. The goal was to compare these approaches and understand their differences in implementation style and performance.

### Description

I initially completed the code following a single approach but later realized I needed to implement it using both concurrent and non-concurrent methods. Due to a headache, I couldn't proceed further with implementing both approaches as planned. However, based on my initial observation:

- The concurrent implementation adopts a more functional programming style compared to the non-concurrent approach.

### Implementation Details

- **Non-Concurrent Approach**: This approach typically involves sequential execution of tasks, where each task is executed in order without overlapping.

- **Concurrent Approach**: In contrast, the concurrent approach utilizes threads or asynchronous processing to execute tasks concurrently. This can lead to better performance in scenarios where tasks can run independently and simultaneously.

### Conclusion

While I couldn't complete both implementations due to unforeseen circumstances, the initial observation suggests a significant difference in programming style between the concurrent and non-concurrent approaches.
